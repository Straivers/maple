# Purpose

The `gfx` package profivides facilities for drawing 2D shapes into images. The
intent is to support multiple backends including GPU-accelerated rendering.
However, the current goal is to produce a reference software renderer that
prioritizes accuracy to serve as the baseline for comparison.
